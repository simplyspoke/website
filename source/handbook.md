This document is intended to be a living document that outlines a collection of self-management policies and practices that are designed with the self employed freelancer in mind. The underlying hope is that by applying some formal structure to our professional lives, we can increase the amount of time we spend on the work we enjoy while limiting our exposure to risks or shortfalls.
